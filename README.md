# Hi 👋 I’m Banele Mkhize

I am a Computer Science graduate with a strong foundation in applied and pure mathematics, and a clear interest in systems thinking and building practical, reliable software. I enjoy working close to real-world problems, where technical decisions, data, and structure come together to create meaningful impact.

I am especially drawn to large systems, data-driven applications, and software that supports real users at scale. I value clean design, thoughtful problem-solving, and continuous learning.

## What drives me

- **Problem-solving through code** – curious by default, deliberate in execution  
- **Systems & data-oriented thinking** – understanding how components interact end-to-end  
- **Applied mathematics** – using mathematical reasoning to strengthen software solutions  
- **Sport & balance** – football and basketball keep me grounded outside of tech  

I am currently deepening my skills across the full stack while continuing to explore different areas of computer science and software engineering.
